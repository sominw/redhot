t5_2r4lw,sjgwvy,"For those of you who also believe that mitochondria impairment/health has something to do with your illness and want to try out more stuff to promote healthy mitochondria, here are two very interesting approaches I have only recently found:

1. Sunlight / Near Infra Red light and its role in mitochondria health and detoxification of cells: [https://youtu.be/5YV\_iKnzDRg](https://youtu.be/5YV_iKnzDRg)

It basically says that the near infra red light that comes from the sun (especially in the mornings and evenings) penetrates the cells and produces melatonin in the cells which apparently is one of the strongest antioxidants we can produce and use in the cells. Melantonin that is produced in the cells is different from supplemental melatonin (which doesn't get to the mitochondrial level of the cells). Apparently this is imperative for mitochondrial health.

The presentation is a bit technical at times, but also with great tips on how to improve such melatonin production in the cells.

2. Getting rid of refined vegetable oils in the diet as they apparently act as inflammatory agents, wreaking havoc on your mitochondria and making you insulin resistant: [https://youtu.be/sr0pG5Tg0D0](https://youtu.be/sr0pG5Tg0D0)

>POTS is one of a group of disorders that have orthostatic intolerance as their primary symptom, in which a reduced volume of blood returns to the heart after the person stands up from a lying-down position. A main symptom in a third of POTS patients is fainting.¬†

>The researchers were from¬†Monash University¬†and led by Professor Sam El-Osta who said that while the gene implicated in POTS ¬†norepinephrine¬†transporter (NET)  had been known for several decades, past research had failed to find a genetic mutation responsible for the symptoms.

t5_2tnlj,qt053t,"1. **Vitamin B9 AKA Folic Acid/Folate:** See this magic pill will increase oxygen in your blood. Keep you warm as a kitten. This lil baby also help your cells regenerate super duper fast. Lovely eh? Each day your immune system is busy torturing your connective tissues. Maybe swallowing this will increase the level of regeneration?
2. **Magnesium:** Magnesium is required for energy production, protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood sugar control and IDK what else. Hell let's just say it's .44 magnum. BANG! It will help you calm the hell outta your tense muscles. Cramps, spams will decrease. You take anti-inflammatory, but see those pills will always make your colon unhappy. Magnesium will make you poop easily. Be careful with the dosage, or your toilet might explode.
3. **Vitamin C:**  One sneeze and your spine hates you. I know. I been there. You don't even wanna sneeze sometimes. Well Vitamin C will keep cold far away. No runny nose. No sneeze. No OUCH! If you love lemonade you are probably lucky. But making homemade lemon water ain't bad either. Good source.
4. **Vitamin D3:** Either the Sun went on a vacation or I don't go out much. Either way Vitamin D3 is lacking in you and me and our brother from a different mother too. Vit D is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps your body absorb calcium and phosphorus. Having the right amount of vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus is important for your bones. Especially those of you taking steroids for pain. Also it improves muscle function and immunity. You can probably search all about the goodness of The Sun. But too much exposure might lead to skin cancer. So Vit D in food and supplement is better.
5. **Calcium:** You need Vit D to absorb the calcium. But what's even better is see you will less likely suffer from acidity problems due to drugs you take or spicy food whatever. Be careful those of you senior. It can mess with your kidney if the dosage is way too much. So call your doctor like I said. Otherwise, if milk is no problem for you, no lactose intolerant then just go drink milk like a baby.
6. **Zinc:** Faster metabolism = less weight. Less weight = less stress to your joints. Overall zinc will improve your metabolism. Zinc is also good for testosterone production so for men Zinc is a must. I don't have to say more about Testosterone. It's life's nectar.
7. **Selenium:**  Selenium is a nutrient that plays a key role in maintaining thyroid hormone metabolism and DNA synthesis and protecting the body from oxidative damage and infection. You need this for metabolism once again and this will help with aging related problems to some degree. Don't need too much of it, can find in multi-vitamin tablets.
8. **Melatonin:** Shitty sleep = shitty recovery. Back pain = Shitty sleep. Thanks to our modern age, we are surrounded by screens which emit light messing up with our sleep cycle. Melatonin is a hormone primarily released by the pineal gland at night, and has long been associated with control of the sleep wake cycle. As a dietary supplement, it is often used for the short term treatment of insomnia. Some studies shows it can act as a painkiller too. However mild. Take a 3 mg pill, and break it half, you got 1.5 mg which is all you need for those days you are just having hard to time sleeping due to whatever reason. Trust me, you will wake up good as new. However, melatonin if you abuse it for years, your body might stop producing it all together. So be careful, talk to a doctor, don't use more than a week if you can. Higher dosage will lead to some horror film in your brainz.. ahem. I mean you will get nightmares most likely if you take too much. Don't do that.
